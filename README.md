# Traffic Signs Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

# Introduction

This code snippet demonstrates a deep learning model for classifying German traffic signs using the LeNet architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing various traffic signs and achieves high accuracy in predicting 43 classes of a given traffic sign image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Keras library (`pip install keras`)
- NumPy library (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib library (`pip install matplotlib`)
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Dataset

The code uses the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, which consists of labeled images of German traffic signs. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Please make sure you have the following files in the same directory as the script:
- `train.p` - Training dataset
- `valid.p` - Validation dataset
- `test.p` - Test dataset

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Copy and paste the code into a Python file or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure you have the dataset files (`train.p`, `valid.p`, and `test.p`) in the same directory as the script.
4. Save the file and run it. The code will load the dataset, preprocess the images, train the LeNet model, and evaluate its performance on the test set. It also includes an example of predicting the class of a custom traffic sign image.

Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, or preprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy or adapt it to your specific use case.

## Notes

- This code assumes a basic understanding of deep learning concepts and assumes the availability of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.
- Ensure your Python environment is correctly set up with the required libraries.
- Modify the dataset file paths if using a different directory structure.
